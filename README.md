# DDI Tensor Decomposition
## Author: Rohan Singh

Repository for Joint Training of Drug-Drug Combination and Drug-Drug Interaction using coupled Tensor-Tensor Factorization. This repository contains source code for a research project that I'm undertaking at Case Western Reserve University.  

The Source code for this project is written in Python.

## Source Code
The source code for this project is divided into the following directories:  
  - **Datasets:** This directory contains source code to make us Datasets (Tensors for DDC and DDI).  
  - **Joint Trainging:** This directory contains source code to train the algorithm on the Datasets.  
  - **Testing:** This directory contains source code to test the performance of our model.
